GuaCoin
=======

A toy cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain which originated from a litter joke and 
was a one-hour project. This is also to demonstrate how easy it is to build your own 
cryptocurrency :P

## Install

It's optional to install `ganache` to start a local Ether network so you can run it locally.

```
npm i -g truffle
npm i
# make sure you have truffle-config.js config correct
truffle migrate --reset
npm run dev
```

## Test

```
truffle test
```
